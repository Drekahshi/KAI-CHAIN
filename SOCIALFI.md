# Kai SocialFi Protocol

**Monetizing Human Attention—Privately, Fairly, and Creatively**

## 🌍 Abstract

**Kai** is a decentralized protocol that transforms your online actions—likes, comments, reading, watching, and even fitness—into real, private rewards. Powered by **agentic AI**, **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**, and **multi-chain smart contracts**, Kai creates a user-owned, creator-driven SocialFi ecosystem.

Kai is not just a social app—it's the **infrastructure for the attention economy**.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

- **$8T of attention value** extracted annually by platforms—users get nothing.
- **Creators** battle opaque algorithms and siloed monetization tools.
- **Web3 remains complex** and alien to most people.

---

## ✅ Kai’s Solution

Kai pays users and creators for verified digital engagement, while:
- Ensuring **total privacy** through zk-SNARKs
- Supporting **offline and low-data onboarding**
- Creating **true ownership** over attention and influence

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

1. **Client Layer**  
   Web app (Next.js), mobile (React Native), browser extension (TypeScript)

2. **Agentic AI**  
   On-device + cloud-based classifiers distinguish quality engagement

3. **ZK Proof Engine**  
   Proves engagement occurred without revealing data

4. **Smart Contracts**  
   Manage quests, NFT achievements, and $GAMI distribution

5. **Backend Infrastructure**  
   Redis, IPFS, Ceramic, GraphQL APIs

6. **Cross-Platform Integration**  
   YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, Lens, Farcaster + ERC-4337 for gasless onboarding

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. Onboarding  
Users connect their wallet via mobile, browser, or USSD. No prior crypto experience needed.

### 2. Engagement Tracking  
Agentic AI classifies:
- Reading time, scroll depth, share/like/comment intent
- Fitness goals and motion data
- Video watch quality and learning patterns

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation  
Each action is converted to a ZK proof:
- **Proves:** “User completed 2 hours of health-related video”
- **Hides:** What was watched, time of day, user identity

### 4. Reward Distribution  
Smart contracts verify proofs and distribute:
- **$GAMI tokens** for all engagement
- **Bonuses** for educational, health, or creator-based content
- **NFT badges** and XP for achievements
- **Streak multipliers** and social challenges

### 5. Gamified Progression  
Kai uses RPG-style leveling and quests:
- XP unlocks premium features
- Quests offer dynamic $GAMI bonuses
- Community challenges drive viral growth

## 💰 Token Structure

### $GAMI — **The Reward Token**
- Infinite supply, algorithmically controlled
- Earned via verified activity
- Stakable for access to deeper rewards and creator tools
- Used in SocialFi pools and NFT quests

### $KAI — **The Governance & Ecosystem Token**
- Fixed supply
- Used for protocol voting, tipping, campaign fees, and premium services
- Powers gas (KAI CENTS), insurance pools, and staking vaults

## 🔐 Privacy-First Design

- **ZKPs** for every proof—privacy is non-negotiable
- **zkBadges** to show off credentials without exposing identity
- **ERC-4337** abstraction for gasless onboarding and account recovery

---

## 🌍 Local & Global Use
